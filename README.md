# Hi there 👋

I'm **Jonathan**, an Engineering Manager at [Lumapps](https://www.lumapps.com/), with over 10 years of experience in IT. I'm passionate about building technology that makes a positive impact on people's lives.

## 🌱 My Philosophy

I design projects with a **low-tech approach**, prioritizing **data privacy** and **governance** to create sustainable and ethical solutions.

## 🚀 Current Projects

- **[navitia-mcp-server](https://github.com/jonperron/python-navitia-client)** - A Python MCP server enabling AI agents to interact with public transport APIs via Navitia.io
- **[med-assist](https://github.com/jonperron/med-assist)** - A AI-powered tool to help doctors summarize their patients' data

## 🛠️ Libraries & Tools

I maintain several open-source libraries:

- **[carbem](https://github.com/jonperron/carbem)** - A Rust library to gather emission data from cloud providers
- **[python-navitia-client](https://github.com/jonperron/python-navitia-client)** - An unofficial SDK for Navitia.io
- **[airflow-providers-navitia](https://github.com/jonperron/airflow-providers-navitia)** - Apache Airflow provider for Navitia.io APIs
- **[airflow-providers-lokalise](https://github.com/jonperron/airflow-providers-lokalise)** - Apache Airflow provider for Lokalise APIs

📦 You can find some of my libraries on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) (carbem, navitia-python-client) and [crates.io](https://crates.io/) (carbem)!

## 🤝 Contributing to Open Source

I actively contribute to projects like **[Boavizta API](https://github.com/Boavizta/boaviztapi)**, which helps measure the environmental impact of digital services.

## 🎲 Hobbies

When I'm not coding, you'll find me:

- 🎩 Performing **magic tricks** and exploring the art of illusion
- 🚶‍♂️ Enjoying **Nordic walking** in nature
- 🎯 Playing **board games** with friends and family
